## Global Pulse News - Project Description
Overview:
Global Pulse News is a dynamic, real-time news portal designed to deliver the latest headlines and trending stories across a wide range of categories. Developed as part of CodTech IT Solutions' internship program, this project demonstrates practical application of API integration, responsive front-end design, and content management using modern web technologies.

The core functionality of Global Pulse News revolves around real-time news updates fetched directly from The Guardian Open Platform API, ensuring users receive the most current information. The project showcases the intern’s competency in full stack web development, focusing primarily on client-side scripting, UI/UX responsiveness, and third-party API utilization.

Key Features:
1. Real-Time News Integration
The website seamlessly integrates with The Guardian API, allowing the platform to fetch live news articles. The data is retrieved using JavaScript's fetch() API and dynamically rendered on the site. The API key must be obtained from The Guardian's developer platform and integrated into the script as shown:

javascript
const API_KEY = 'YOUR API KEY';
const BASE_URL = 'https://content.guardianapis.com/search';

2. Content Display Sections
Global Pulse News includes several content-rich sections to improve reader engagement:

Breaking News Ticker: An auto-refreshing ticker that updates every 5 minutes, displaying the most recent and urgent headlines.

Featured Article: A visually impactful display of the top news article, including a large image, headline, and brief description.

Top Stories Grid: A structured grid layout featuring trending articles across various topics.

Photo Stories: A gallery-style section showcasing image-based articles for quick visual browsing.

Latest Updates: A simple, clean list view of the latest stories.

Spotlight Section: Highlights the most-read or most-shared stories.

World of Stars: A curated feed focused on celebrity and entertainment news.

3. Navigation and Filtering
The website supports intuitive navigation and content discovery through:

Category Filters: Users can filter news by categories such as World, India, Business, Technology, Sports, etc.

Location Selector: Readers can view region-specific news for Global, India, USA, and UK.

Responsive Hamburger Menu: Designed for mobile users, this collapsible menu enhances accessibility and navigation.

4. Responsive Web Design
The layout adapts seamlessly across devices:

Desktop View: Employs a three-column layout to display more information at a glance.

Mobile View: Automatically adjusts to a single-column format for optimized readability and user experience on smaller screens.

5. Pagination System
To manage large sets of news data efficiently, the site includes a built-in pagination system, allowing users to browse older stories without overloading the page.

Technical Stack:
HTML5 & CSS3 for semantic and styled structure.

JavaScript (ES6) for DOM manipulation and API communication.

The Guardian Open Platform API for real-time news content.

Responsive Web Design Principles for mobile compatibility.
